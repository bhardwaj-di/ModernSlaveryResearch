# ModernSlaveryResearch

- GradedSystemAlgo - In this notebook we created a metric to grade the statement, we performed the topic modeling and got the topics, these topics were given weights. This grading can be improved by trying inter category closely related words or labeling the statements as positive negative or neutral and then using Transformers for further statements.

- Topic modeling performed can be seen at this link - https://github.com/nitinkmittal/modern_slavery_registry/tree/master/notebooks
